## Tools for PSO update-rule analysis 
- effectiveness analysis/summary of different update-rule algorithms.
- different algorithms effectiveness comparison.  

# Directories for this project:
- src: source code of program.
- data: data generated by program, as well as scripts for making drawings.
- test: unit tests for code.
- doc: documentation for source code generated by doxygen.

# To run 
- `make && ./a.out` 
- default main.cpp content would perform step quantity dependency of two pso algorithms: traditional and stochastic approach. It will also generate data for drawings in data directory.

# To draw resuls
- requirements: ranger, gnuplot.
- default main.cpp content will create data/stepQuantityDependency directory with some data
- when the code is compiled and run,  execute: 
	- `./data/drawCharts stepQuantityDependency`
